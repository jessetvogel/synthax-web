# Note: make sure you have a stereo output for this example.

# In order to output a signal (without panning), we use the output-instruction:
oscillator osc_1: frequency = 220, wave = "sine", amplitude = 0.1
output osc_1

# Panning can be used by passing an additional parameter in the output-instruction:
# a value of '-1' means left panning and '+1' means right panning.
oscillator osc_2: frequency = 440, wave = "triangle", amplitude = 0.2
oscillator LFO: frequency = 0.5
output osc_2 @ LFO
