				Synthesizer configurations can be specified in a text files by a list of instructions. Each instruction describes either part of the audial component of the synthesizer, or part of the visual component.

				Below are some examples of how such files can be created. For a full overview of the possiblities, take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="/doc.html">documentation</a>. Now, open your favorite text-editor and let's get started!
			</p>
			<h2>Example 1: creating oscillators</h2>
			<p>
				Create a text-file with the following instructions:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				oscillator osc: frequency = 440, amplitude = 0.2, wave = "saw"<br/>
				output osc
			</div>
			<p>
				The first line creates an <span class="mono">oscillator</span> node (that we name <span class="mono">osc</span>) that oscillates at 440Hz with an amplitude of 0.2 with a sawtooth waveform. The second line says that the signal produced by this oscillator is to be outputted. When loaded into Synthax, it should sound as follows:
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
	  					<source src="/audio/example-1-1.wav" type="audio/wav">
						Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now consider the following change:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				oscillator osc: frequency = 440, amplitude = 0.2, wave = "saw", <span class="highlight">detune = LFO * 50</span> <br/>
				<span class="highlight">oscillator LFO: frequency = 1</span> <br/>
				output osc
			</div>
			<p>
				Here we connected a low-frequency oscillator (<span class="mono">LFO</span>) to the detuning of our oscillator <span class="mono">osc</span>, so that the detuning will oscillate between <span style="position: relative; top: -2px;">Â±</span>50 cents. Note that an audio node can be referenced before it is defined.
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
	  					<source src="/audio/example-1-2.wav" type="audio/wav">
						Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, suppose that we want to route this signal through a low-pass filter with some resonance (say a Q-factor of 3) and oscillating cutoff frequency (say between 0Hz and 10,000Hz). We make the following changes:
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				oscillator osc: frequency = 440, amplitude = 0.2, wave = "saw", detune = LFO * 50<br/>
				oscillator LFO: frequency = 1<br/>
				<span class="highlight">filter flt: input = osc, frequency = 5000 + 5000 * LFO, Q = 3</span><br/>
				output <span class="highlight">flt</span>
			</div>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
	  					<source src="/audio/example-1-3.wav" type="audio/wav">
						Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>

			<h2>Example 2: responding to MIDI input</h2>
			<p>
				Now we want to create a synth that responds to key presses on a connected MIDI device. For this, we would need as many oscillators as the maximum number of keys that we allow to be pressed simultaniously. To do so, we create a <i>group</i> that keeps track of the keys pressed, and assigns unused oscillators (and other nodes) to the keys.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				group A: voices = 16<br/>
				A oscillator osc: frequency = key_frequency, wave = "triangle", amplitude = env<br/>
				A adsr env: attack = 0.0, decay = 0.2, sustain = 0.2, release = 0.5<br/>
				<br/>
				output osc
			</div>
			<p>
				The first line creates a group named <span class="mono">A</span> that allows for 16 notes to be played at once. In this group we put a family of oscillators and ADSR-envelopes that are connected. Note that the oscillator is set to oscillate at <span class="mono">key_frequency</span>, which refers to the frequency of the note that it is assigned to. Now the synth should react to playing notes on your keyboard.
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
					<source src="/audio/example-2-1.wav" type="audio/wav">
					Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to change how a group responds to key presses by settings its <span class="mono">mode</span>. The following adjustment makes the group <i>monophonic</i>, i.e. it only uses one voice at a time. The <span class="mono">glide</span> parameter specifies how long it should take (in seconds per octave) for <span class="mono">key_frequency</span> to 'glide' between consecutive notes.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				group A: voices = 16, <span class="highlight">mode = "mono", glide = 0.2</span><br/>
				A oscillator osc: frequency = key_frequency, wave = "triangle", amplitude = env<br/>
				A adsr env: attack = 0.0, decay = 0.0, sustain = 0.2, release = 0.5<br/>
				<br/>
				output osc
			</div>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
					<source src="/audio/example-2-2.wav" type="audio/wav">
					Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>

			<h2>Example 3: creating a user interface</h2>
			<p>
				In order to change parameters while playing, we must create visual components that the player can interact with. Suppose we have an oscillator that is passed through a low-pass filter, and we want to control the filter's cutoff frequency.
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				oscillator osc: wave = "square", frequency = 100, amplitude = 0.2<br/>
				filter flt: input = osc, frequency = cutoff<br/>
				output flt<br/>
				<br/>
				param cutoff: min = 50, max = 5000, curve = "exp"<br/>
				ui knob: param = cutoff, x = 0, y = 0, label = "cutoff"
			</div>
			<p>
				A <span class="mono">param</span> node denotes a parameter that can be controlled through MIDI. We have set its minimum value to 50, its maximum to 5000, with exponential interpolation. The last line create a knob that is linked to this parameter. This looks like:
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				<img src="/img/examples/example-3-1.png" />	
			</p>
			<p>
				Now turning the knob should affect the cutoff frequency of the filter. It is also possible to control the knob via MIDI: right-click the knob and then turn a knob or move a slider on your MIDI controller to link it to the parameter.
			</p>
			<p class="centered">
				<audio controls>
					<source src="/audio/example-3-1.wav" type="audio/wav">
					Your browser does not support the audio element.
				</audio>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="mono">x</span> and <span class="mono">y</span> coordinates refer to a grid of 64 x 64 pixels. For example, if we add some more visual components,
			</p>
			<div class="code">
				...<br/>
				ui keyboard: x = 1, y = 0, width = 4, range = "C3 to C5"<br/>
				ui box: x = 0, y = -0.25, width = 5.25, height = 1.5, color = "#3280b5", rounded = 0.1
			</div>
			<p>
				it will result in the following:
			</p>
